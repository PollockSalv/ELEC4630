ELEC4630 Computer Vision and Image Processing

Here are a few Colab notebooks to get you stated with deep learning.  We have decided to use Colab notebooks because you can access them from anywhere and can run your code on a cloud-based GPU.  

How to run a Colab notebook

1. In Github, open a notebook with ipynb extension
2. You should see a "Run in Colab" button
3. Click this and the notebook will open in Google Colab
4. You can use Runtime/Run all to run all the code, or you can execute one codeblock at a time.
